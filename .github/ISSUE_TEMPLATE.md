Thanks for adding to the conversation around Data Together üéâ

In addition to general thoughts and questions we have a couple defined ways to explore topics, examples, challenges or opportunities:
- Question, get right to whatever is on your mind
- Roundtable, help host a guided 30-min discussion during our standing rountable time

Check out the templates below, if they don't cover what you need, go freeform!

---

Title: [short form of your questions]

[Ask your question! Tho try to keep it to a single question. Providing additional context and links to other resources are always good :)]

---

Title: Roundtable: [topic]

[1-2 context description, highlighting open questions or areas that need to be expanded on]

Willing to Host: [your name if you are!]  
Preparation: [identify any todos, links, helpful resources that people should check out]

üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è _what are [**weekly roundtables**](https://github.com/datatogether/datatogether/blob/master/guidelines/roundtable.md) anyway? They are discussions of a Data Together-related topic, challenge, or question led by a rotating facilitator. If you are hosting, be sure to check out [**how to host**](https://github.com/datatogether/datatogether/blob/master/guidelines/roundtable.md#how-to-host) (and add any improvements!)_
